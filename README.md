<h1>CS224n : Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</h1>
Completed all the course assignments and am highly grateful to the Course Instructors, <strong>Richard Socher</strong> and <strong>Christopher Manning</strong> and all the <b>TAs</b> for helping me understand the complex concepts of NLP and Deep Learning with so much ease.

It was an enriching experience and would highly recommend the course to anyone who wants to build their theoretical concepts in the field of NLP and Deep Learning.

I would like to thank Stanford for supporting open learning which has enabled me to venture into the course
